Attention Deficit /Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
The examinee obtained a score in the Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder Test classified in High category, which indicates that there is a high probability of having attention deficit/hyperactivity.

Attention deficit and hyperactivity is a disorder characterized by a constant pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity and occurs at school and home. Problems related to attention include making mistakes due to negligence, not accomplishing tasks, organization and attention maintenance problems, and being easily distracted. Hyperactivity problems include excessive fidgeting, running, or climbing things when this isn't appropriate. Impulsivity reflected in impatience, difficulty of waiting role, rush to answer, and the repetitive interruption. Many students who suffer from attention deficit and hyperactivity have symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity; however, some others may exhibit symptoms of only one set. 

Nearly 10% of school-age children are diagnosed by attention deficit and hyperactivity. These children behave without thinking, are hyperactive, and have difficulty to concentrate. They understand what is expected from them but they face a problem to sit down and focus on details.

 These students are described by their teachers as being impulsive and misbehaved in classroom unless kept under strict supervision. They are distinguished by being hyperactive, talkative, and interrupting others while speaking. These students exhibit various characteristics that don't enhance academic achievement such as distraction, insufficient persistence, disorganized effort and disobeying teacher directives. They rarely remain in their seats; and they don't work independently, wait their turn in activity, and never listen when other students speak.

Their parents often state that their academic achievement is weak and they are in need of effective discipline. They often don't complete tasks and they are characterized by disorganization, poor memory, and hyperactivity. This is in addition to acting in way that irritates others and they may even lie to find a way around the problem.

Psychologists and teachers often notice some attributes such as unintended anger, distraction, disobedience, hating school, hyperactivity and irritability. These students may admit that they misbehave inside school, and teachers complain that they can't sit still. They may describe themselves as acting clumsy and impatient. They do not maintain harmony with their teachers and others think that they "treat them badly".

Subtests Scores Interpretation:
Nonverbal Fluid Reasoning.
The examinee`s “NVFR” score classified as “Average ”. This means that examinee has an average ability in solving novel figural problems and identifying sequences of pictured objects or matrix-type figural and geometric patterns.

Performance in this test requires the following primary cognitive abilities:-

• Attention to visual cues: which requires the examinee’s ability to direct his/her attention to search visually for the meaning of pictures, drawings, illustrations, objects, etc.
• Concentration for long periods: which requires the examinee’s ability to exercise mental control over his/her mental processes to examine, inspect, complete, or respond to tasks presented in the environment.
• Visualization of abstract stimuli: which requires the examinee’s ability to apprehend the significance of pictures, drawings, or illustrations showing abstract designs and objects (e.g., geometric shapes).
• Recognition of patterns:  which requires the examinee’s ability to apprehend visual or verbal patterns, such as repeated occurrences of objects or words, and to identify repeated elements or patterns.
• Synthesis of information:  which requires the examinee’s ability to perceive and understand each part of a visual field or a collection of information presented in various media and to identify major themes or main ideas and integrate them into a summarizing or conclusive whole.
• Mental verbal mediation: which requires the examinee’s ability to "talk to oneself" sub vocally while attempting to solve problems or complete tasks; to employ verbal codes, memory prompts, or identifiers to assist in remembering a string of information.
• Search strategies: which requires the examinee’s ability to exert mental control over his/her plans and actions for inspecting visual material or any visual field; to search a visual field using an efficient plan and effectively find important information.
• Track visual sequences:  which requires the examinee’s ability to control his/her visual perception so that an entire sequence of pictures or visual events is scanned, held in memory, and then mentally reviewed and evaluated.
• Visual discrimination:  which requires the examinee’s ability to make fine distinctions among elements of a visual field; to identify matching or differentiated elements of the visual field. 
• Visual scanning : which requires the examinee’s ability to exert control over his/her eye-scanning behavior to systematically inspect a visual field, picture, illustration, written text, or other visual material prior to responding to the visual material.
• Mental review of potential answers:  which requires the examinee’s ability to develop and follow a plan to examine a range of possible responses to a question, problem, or task and to mentally scan all probable correct answers to increase chances of responding correctly and eliminating improbably wrong answers.

Performance in this test also requires the following secondary cognitive abilities:-

• Visualization of meaningful stimuli: which requires the examinee’s ability to apprehend the significance of pictures, drawings, or illustrations showing lifelike scenes of people, places, and common objects.
• Inspection of objects by touch:  which requires the examinee’s ability to manually inspect with fingers and hands various objects, toys, puzzle pieces, etc., for purposes of identifying or studying them.
• Freedom from visual neglect:  which requires the examinee’s ability to be free of the neuropsychological condition (perhaps originating in brain dysfunction) in which portions of the visual field (e.g., lower right quadrant) are blocked from the examinee's perception. The effect of the condition is that the examinee cannot see part of a picture.
• Toleration of ambiguity:  which requires the examinee’s ability to show patience with difficult, ambiguous tasks and to persevere in solving problems even when full information is unavailable.
• Patience with difficult tasks: which requires the examinee’s ability to show patience with difficult tasks and complex problems that require concentrated effort and perseverance in finding solutions.
• Trial and error strategies:  which requires the examinee’s ability to experiment (often only mentally) with different options, alternatives, or solutions to tasks to predict which option will lead to a correct solution and which alternative may lead to error.
• Cognitive flexibility:  which requires the examinee’s ability to allow his/her mind to reflect on situations and tasks and to consider a wide range of possible responses (even those that defy accepted opinions) to find a creative task solution.
• Recognition and evaluation of pictures:  which requires the examinee’s ability to visually recognize elements of pictures, comprehend the overall meaning of illustrations, and use judgment to evaluate the purpose, message, or significance of the picture; to judge the quality of pictures.

A psychologist should use his/her clinical sense when there is a mixed pattern of the same capacity by the signs (s) and (w), or (s) and (-), or (w) and (+), to confirm or refute this mixture on the basis of qualitative information written by the examiner during the evaluation. This is due the lack of clear evidence on quantitative data for such mixed patterns. For example, when an examinee gets (s) and (w) on "Concentration for Long Periods", this may indicate that the examinee has strong concentration for long periods on visual stimuli and weak concentration for long periods on auditory stimuli.

Attention Deficit /Hyperactivity Disorder Test
The examinee obtained a score in the Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder Test classified in High category, which indicates that there is a high probability of having attention deficit/hyperactivity.

Attention deficit and hyperactivity is a disorder characterized by a constant pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity and occurs at school and home. Problems related to attention include making mistakes due to negligence, not accomplishing tasks, organization and attention maintenance problems, and being easily distracted. Hyperactivity problems include excessive fidgeting, running, or climbing things when this isn't appropriate. Impulsivity reflected in impatience, difficulty of waiting role, rush to answer, and the repetitive interruption. Many students who suffer from attention deficit and hyperactivity have symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity; however, some others may exhibit symptoms of only one set. 

Nearly 10% of school-age children are diagnosed by attention deficit and hyperactivity. These children behave without thinking, are hyperactive, and have difficulty to concentrate. They understand what is expected from them but they face a problem to sit down and focus on details.

 These students are described by their teachers as being impulsive and misbehaved in classroom unless kept under strict supervision. They are distinguished by being hyperactive, talkative, and interrupting others while speaking. These students exhibit various characteristics that don't enhance academic achievement such as distraction, insufficient persistence, disorganized effort and disobeying teacher directives. They rarely remain in their seats; and they don't work independently, wait their turn in activity, and never listen when other students speak.

Their parents often state that their academic achievement is weak and they are in need of effective discipline. They often don't complete tasks and they are characterized by disorganization, poor memory, and hyperactivity. This is in addition to acting in way that irritates others and they may even lie to find a way around the problem.

Psychologists and teachers often notice some attributes such as unintended anger, distraction, disobedience, hating school, hyperactivity and irritability. These students may admit that they misbehave inside school, and teachers complain that they can't sit still. They may describe themselves as acting clumsy and impatient. They do not maintain harmony with their teachers and others think that they "treat them badly".

Parents usually describe these children that they like arguments and want to have the final word. They complain from adults' commands who blame others for their own problems. Their disobedience negatively affects the family environment. Their emotional weakness appears when they are easily annoyed from the "constructive" criticism, when succeed or fail, or for a simple reason or without any clear reason. They annoy their peers by offending them, making fun of them, behave badly, or through showing indifference to others' feelings in other ways. Teachers rarely notice that they display cooperative or polite behaviors, or good conduct.

They are likely to express their dislike for school and teachers, and they fight with their peers and achieve weak grades. Usually, there is a behavior that reflects problems of anger, irritation, defiance, and weak social skills. They express their lack of interest in school, and they admit that they have tendency to use confrontational approach and don't control their anger. Also, they admit that they are moody, misbehave, and are aware of causing problems to their parents and teachers.

Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments, or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to animals or other individuals.
2
2
Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals that occurring within a 12-month period.
0
B
The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors.
6
C
The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/ or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power, and intimidation).
3
D
The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either problems to the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences.
7
E
Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent to the developmental level).

F
The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder), and are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a substance abuse). 



Kleptomania test
The examinee obtained a score in the Kleptomania test classified in Low category, which indicates that there is no probability of having Kleptomania. Kleptomania is an impulse control disorder characterized by failure to resist urges to steal objects that are not often essential for personal use or for their monetary value. Occasionally normal individuals have a desire to steal, but they think of the consequences. Individuals with kleptomania have also the same ideas, but they constantly are unable to resist these urges. Kleptomania is a rare disorder that diagnosed in about0.3% to 0.6% of the population. Females outnumber males at a ratio of 3:1.

Pyromania test
The examinee obtained a score in the Pyromania test classified in Low category, which indicates that there is no probability of having pyromania. Individuals with pyromania start fires deliberately for pleasure or satisfaction derived from the relief of tension experienced before the fire-setting. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)classifies pyromania under category of Disruptive, Impulse-control, and Conduct disorders. Individuals with pyromania face difficulty in controlling urges, which means that pyromaniac fails to resist the impulse of starting fire and this occurs unintentionally and without planning.

Deviant Behavior Domain:
The examinee obtained a score in the Deviant Behavior test classified in Average category, which indicates that there are average symptoms of deviant behaviors. This domain describes behaviors that considered illegal and usually refers to the behaviors that will help turn the child into a criminal when reaches adulthood. In educational, health and psychological domains, all or some of these behaviors called "antisocial behaviors". Children or adolescents who exhibit frequent episodes of such behaviors are sometimes diagnosed with "conduct (behavior) disorder".

Antisocial Behavior Test
The examinee obtained a score in the Antisocial Behavior test classified in Low category. Antisocial behaviors are disruptive acts characterized by covert and overt hostility and intentional aggression toward others. Antisocial behaviors exist along a severity continuum and include repeated violations of social rules, defiance of authority and of the rights of others, deceitfulness, theft, and reckless disregard for self and others. Antisocial behavior can be identified in children as young as three or four years of age. If left unchecked, these behavior patterns will persist and escalate in severity over time, becoming a chronic behavioral disorder.
Antisocial behavior may be overt, involving aggressive actions against siblings, peers, parents, teachers, or other adults such as verbal abuse, bullying, and hitting; or covert involving aggressive actions against property such as theft, vandalism, and fire setting. Covert antisocial behaviors in early childhood may include sneaking, lying, or secretly destroying another's property. Antisocial behaviors also include drug and alcohol abuse.

Behavioral Dyscontrol Test:
The examinee obtained a score in the Behavioral Dyscontrol test classified in Below Average category, which indicates that the examinee has an above average ability to control emotions, behaviors, and desires in different situations. Self-control is a feature or trait that helps the individual to restrain himself from doing things he wants even though they may be among his interests and desires. In other words, it is the ability to have a control over emotions and behavior against temptations and impulses. Behavioral control stops arousing anger. If there is a statement that can describe the simplest possible solutions for 98% of the conflicts in the workplace, it would be self-control!
Generally, self-control helps the individual not to indulge in hatred, envy, jealousy, fear, revenge; and any other emotions that destroy health, safety, and morale at workplace. Characteristics such as greed, selfishness, and arrogance indicate the lack of improvement in self-control. Self-control is a skill that does not allow your emotions to be extreme; because both are destructive.

Noncompliance:
The examinee obtained a score in the Noncompliance test classified in severe category. Children and adolescents whose scores within this range described as being impulsive, irresponsible, argumentative, and agitated. They break rules, disrupt classroom activities, complain from adults' requests, and blame others for their own problems. Teachers describe them with poor adaptive skills, which are experienced in interaction with peers; they interrupt and insult them and in return they receive criticism and provoke peers' anger. They are not be responsive to discipline, and stubborn, and lie to get out of trouble. These children often threaten, hit, push, provoke and make fun of their peers who criticize and reject them in return. Disciplinary actions are not effective and there is a power struggle between them and their parents.

Hallucinations and Delusions Test
The examinee obtained a score in the Hallucinations and Delusions test classified in Low category. Hallucinations and Delusions test measures sensory experience that occurs in the absence of external stimuli that match the proper sensory system. Hallucinations are defined as perceptions of stimuli in the conscious state that do not exist and have the qualities of the real sensory stimuli such as; auditory hallucinations in which the individual may hear voices that do not really exist. Delusions are commonly defined as false beliefs that are not based in reality such as; the delusion that someone is hurting or bothering you; or making certain comments.

 - Family needs family counseling to clarify the role of parents inside the family and the role of each member in it. Family should be trained on the successful methods of dialogue and listening, which help in understanding and solving problems and prevent their aggregation in order not to turn into conflict and severe disagreements.    
 - It may be useful that the teacher or the parents clarify the consequences of the behavior conducted by the child, such as the child may see himself/herself in a video while he/she is doing something so he/she could realize his/her behavior from another perspective. Therefore, he/she tries to control such behavior. Self-regulation should be used through self-monitoring and self-enhancement, as the child learns to control himself/ herself in certain circumstances, and then such control is generalized to similar situations, and he/she starts to observe himself/herself and his/her behaviors. He/she should be reinforced when he/she behaves in an improved manner.
 - Deal with the child in a quiet manner and privately instead of accusing him/her. If you do so, you will be able to help the child to solve his/her problem. Use the method of concern-attention. Show suspicion and disappointment because of this behavior but do not show anger and condemnation.
Discuss with him/her the situations that he/she might face and ask him/ her for the appropriate solutions for these problems. Such situations may are like: what will you do if you see your friend takes someone's money? or what will you do if someone asks you to help him/her in cheating in the exam? Such situations help the child to learn the learn values and form successful relationships.         
 - Be very compassionate with him/her and firm at the same time, and clarify to him/her that the secret of maturity  is not about the age or experience, however; it is about turning from a person who constantly receives to someone who grants always. Children or teenagers always want others to see them mature.
 - Get used when the child leaves the room while he/she is angry, do not go after him/her, ask him/her to change his/her behavior and apologize, as this will lead to an embarrassing situation and makes the father/mother seem unjust or guilty in front of others. However, talk with him/her privately. The members of the family will appreciate your behavior and the way you control the situation.    
 - Do not involve yourself with the child in a struggle over power, because you as a father, a mother, or a teacher already have power and once you involve in a conflict with the child this means that you give the child power.
Support any positive behavior or any change that happens in behavior. Tell the child specifically about any changes that you have observed in his/her behavior. Before all of this, clarify to him/her the benefits of such changes.
  
 - Family needs family counseling that helps them to settle conflicts inside the family and to change the system it and its customs with focusing on the psychological aspects within the members of the family.

Wait for any improvement in behavior and make sure you give him/her a positive reaction. 
Ask for the help of the teachers. Explain to them your concern that the continuation of this behavior will make other children and siblings stay away from this child and work inside the classroom will be affected with such.
Agree with the child about an eye or hand signal to help him/her realize the unacceptable behavior when he/she does such.    
 - The child needs behavior modification through contracts system, positive reinforcement of accepted behavior, the system of points, and avoidance of punishment or rebuke as this increases his/her stubborn behavior.  
 - Try the method of feeling sorry. If you told the child that you feel sorry for him/her because he/she is always moody and asked him/her what you can do to help him/her, you may find a new attitude at all. First, because few feel sorry about the condition of this child. Second, he/she does not want you to feel so because this makes him/her feel inferior. Remember that this child should feel that he/she controls himself/herself, therefore; address this need after using this method.  
 - The child needs trainings on self-control and to be able to direct his/her behavior on his/her own through self-talk in a loud voice in the beginning then silently like I have to play quietly, in addition to positive reinforcement through points which increase in each time the child plays quietly and by the increase of the number of the times that he/she does so, or by the system of behavioral contract.  
 - Talk to him/her quietly about how he/she lacks self-control. Do not attack his/her agitation and do not describe him/her as being good or bad, or you will not be able to talk with him/her. 
 Make a plan to help him/her control his/her anger, usually as simple as agreeing on a signal, which makes the child ask for permission or go to his/her room, which reduces the intensity of behavior immediately.
 - The child needs family guidance, and family needs to be educated with the correct methods of bringing up and the importance of parental compatibility in the method of bringing up, as one of the parents should not punish the child for his/her negative behavior while the other party neglects this behavior, stops the punishment or later punish him/her for such behavior in one time and does not punish him/her in another time. Also, directions given to the child should not be contradicted with those of the parents, as this increases the tension, dispersion, and his/her inability to distinguish between what is wrong and right.             
 - Needs training on positive social skills that qualify him/her to interact in a good way with others. 
 - Needs to know the consequences of his/her wrong behaviors and to use methods of behavior modification like contracts system which is prior agreement on the desired behaviors and the consequences of such behaviors and also negative behaviors and their consequences. Also, the system of self-control can be used, through which the child could control his/her behaviors on his/her own.      
 - Needs exercises to help him/her think about the type of his/her companions, the desired behaviors, and the reasons that make him/her prefer problematic individuals. Also, he/she needs sessions of group therapy.  
 - He/she may need to use the method of regular exposure to situations that bother him/her and training on how to face them. Also, he/she needs training on the methods of relaxation. 
 - Family should discuss calmly the thoughts of the child about his/her peers and try to make the child acquire a set of positive social skills that enable him/her of positive social communication with others.   
 - The beginning with him/her should present a settlement for such child; this is the best way of dealing with him/her. Do not ask him/her to give up, as all people asked him/her to give up on everything and not to get anything, and here lies revenge. Settlement with the child enables to change his/her behavior while saving-face.
 - Family needs guidance to restore balance within the family, to educate parents about how to communicate with their children, to improve relationships between parents and children, and to resolve conflicts between them.
 - Needs psychological and rehabilitative therapy and this may require hospitalization in a safe environment )a place of rehabilitation( and constant monitoring of his/her behavior. Therapy should be based on rational arguments and benefit from mistakes that have been committed in the past with emphasis on physical and tangible values of social behavior. He/she also needs family counseling and family cooperation in treatment.  
 - Needs behavior modification and methods like system of contracts and positive reinforcement with points could be used. 
 - Needs behavior modification to control tantrums and know the underlying reasons behind his/her tantrums. Also, he/she needs relaxation exercises. 
 - ·         Needs to satisfy the secondary needs, as he/she may lie to pretend strength, independence and success.
Do not ignore the child as the experiments proved that ignorance pushes the child to more of lies.
Usually poor self-esteem is often the cause behind this behavior. This is a problem of identity and self-esteem. Perhaps the child lies as an attempt to be successful or to receive attention and protection. So, lying is a means of self-preservation.
Do not subject lying to logical reasoning. Logical reasoning does not apply to unreasonable behavior. 
Try to discover the pressures that push the child to lie.
Use the method of attention distraction if possible. Distract the child's attention away from lying by paying attention towards him/her in a way that interrupts his/her lying. For instance, say to him Sorry, Adam, can you pass me these books? Use the child's name with interrupting methods. Do not listen to lying before you correct it, you should correct it immediately. This method gives him attention without listening to lies. 
Also, use the method of repetition. Ask the child simply to repeat what you realized that it was a lie. He/she will usually tell you do not bother or Forget this it was not important. A liar child will not repeat what he/she said, if you raised your eyebrows and gave him/her a look that indicates that you are aware of the truth and said to him, Can you repeat what you said again. 
If lying is excessive, discuss this problem with the teacher or the psychologist in the presence of the child. Make sure you talk more than the attendees to let the child know that you are in control of the situation and that you are qualified for it.
Treat the child in a way that helps in establishing a relation between you and him/her instead of rejecting this child, show him/her that you love him/her but you do not love lying.    
Do not call the child a liar or else you will hurt him/her and such injury cannot be treated or maybe he/she may deny that he/she is lying. 
Try to give the child more time, sit with him/her, talk with him/her quietly and refuse to give up.
Try to touch his/her wound but in such a nice way that it causes him/her the least possible harm, so talk to him/her about storytelling, imagination and protection instead of lying.

 - Needs cognitive behavioral therapy to find out the causes and attitudes that negatively affect the emotional mood and to find out its reasons for treatment.
 - Needs behavior modification, the method of points, and behavior contracting can be used. Positive reinforcement can be used in each time the child carries out the orders whether the orders of the parents or in the school, and to avoid using stubbornness or rebuking with the child.   
 - Involve the child in the process of decision making; this makes him/her lose most of his/her weapons if you offered him/her participation. 
Make sure that he/she realizes the rules, then talk to them about the reason behind establishing such rules and ask him/her to participate.
You should realize that arousing problems continuously may indicate sadness.

First, because few feel sorry about the condition of this child. Second, he/she does not want you to feel so because this makes him/her feel inferior. Remember that this child should feel that he/she controls himself/herself, therefore; address this need after using this method.
Avoid any situation arouses anger. The best time to talk to the child is when the child is not angry or annoyed. The deep insight towards this child will reveal that he/she is calm, nice, gentle and sagacious when he/she is not angry. You should be aware of this fact and try to get close to the child in these times. 
Talk to the child about how he/she lacks self-control. Say to the child: It is not wrong to be angry. However, what you do with your anger is the right or wrong. Do not attack his/her emotion and describe him/her good or bad, or you will not be able to talk to your child. 
Put a plan to help the child to control his/her anger. It is usually a simple thing like agreeing on some signal to make the child ask for permission or to go to his/her room as this may reduce the severity of behavior immediately.

 - Needs a program to improve his/her life skills and training on how to satisfy his/her needs on his/her own.  
 - Reasons behind doing this behavior in school should be known, and whether the group of peers or family problems has a role in this. It is important to listen to the child carefully and show him/her interest. When you deal with him/her in a way that indicates interest, he/she will do his/her best to become better and to show you that he/she is trying. Therefore, face him/her in a manner that shows interest.   
 - He/she should be motivated on initiative and on the importance of striving for achieving goals.   
 - The child should feel safe, loved and his/her self-confidence should be increased. Also, family should be aware how to deal with the child's fears and needs and the negative effect of conditioned love on the child.

A lot of tough children in fact are sensitive and delicate, however; they have not met a lot of nice people in their lives. When he/she finds a person that truly and personally cares for him/her, he/she does his/her best to succeed in school. 

 - Tell him/her it is not intelligent to do things that make people walk away from him/her. Tell him/her the smart one knows well how to approach to people. The child will accept what you say to him/her, but he/she will need help through practical examples or suggestions. Clarify to him/her that he/she should not consider the thoughts and experiences of others less important than his/hers. Also, tell him/her that he/she has made a mistake when he/she did not realize the importance of working with others and not to stand against them, and he/she will be able to solve the problem because he/she has a dire need to be accepted by others.    
 - Talk to him/her about not to give up and urge him/her to be always outstanding by saying You do not compete with others, but compete with yourself. You are giving up and that is the problem. Do not urge him/her to compete with another child. 
Help him/her to identify a point of strength and use it in making him/her accomplish achievements beyond current achievements. Do not choose a big goal but choose a small short term goal as this is a very effective way. When you think about the purpose of the goals, remember that what matters is not achieving goals, but to highlight any progress the child makes towards the goal. Make this child always work with colleagues who need help. The most important procedure is to advise him/her about competition by saying I care about your view about yourself and I worry about comparing yourself with any other person, as the only worthwhile competition is with yourself. Keep talking about self-competition as the only logical purpose is improvement. Once the child accepts that, he/she will start working according to the criteria he/she has set and not according to the criteria set by others. Therefore, his/her accomplishments will be appropriate for him/her abilities.     
 - Needs behavioral therapy in which self-image is improved, self confidence is increased and to learn social skills that activate his/her role in the group of peers, and to know how to face his/her problems with the group of peers. 
 - Keep calm when he/she is angry. Do not threaten. If you did so, the child will be angrier and might say I do not care about what you do. Do not suppress the child. If you did so, he/she may taunt or mock you. Try the method of feeling sorry. If you told the child that you feel sorry for him/her because he/she is always angry. If you ask him/her what you can do to help him/her, you may find a new attitude at all. First, because few feel sorry about the condition of this child. Second, he/she does not want you to feel so because this makes him/her feel inferior. Remember that this child should feel that he/she controls himself/herself, therefore; address this need after using this method.  Avoid any situation arouses anger.

You should be aware of this fact and try to get close to the child in these times. 
Talk to the child about how he/she lacks self-control. Say to the child: It is not wrong to be angry. However, what you do when you are angry is be angry. However, what you do with your anger is the right or wrong. Do not attack his/her emotion because this makes you unable to talk with him/her. 
Put a plan to help the child to control his/her anger. It is usually a simple thing like agreeing on some signal to make the child ask for permission or to go to his/her room as this may reduce the severity of behavior immediately. Do not ever reward the behavior of anger.         
 - Accept the apology of the child, after that talk with him/her privately about bearing the responsibility for every time he/she forgets. Set definite rules for what will happen after a specific period if the child keeps forgetting his/her assignments and tasks, these rules should be fair and reasonable, then apply them. When you talk with him/her use words that indicate you attention. Tell him/her What did we say? instead of I told you ... so and so then leave him/her see what he/she had to remember. Ban him/her from a privilege in every time he/she repeats this behavior, and then give him/her this privilege when he/she succeeds in bearing the responsibility. Do not make a problem for this behavior. Be patient with him/her as such change will not happen quickly and the child will forget another time. However, your support for him/her is very important. Help the child to begin in a long-term program to improve himself/ herself. Do not be angry for his/her forgetfulness and do not take the behavior personally. Remind the child with what he/she has to do and you may write a note to remind him/her, as this is a kind of care.

A diagnosis of specific learning disability according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) requires the presence of at least one of the following difficulties lasting at least six months: (1) Difficulty reading words accurately or slowly despite effort (for example, reading one word out loud loudly). Inaccurately or slowly and hesitantly, often guesses words, has difficulty with phonemes) (2) Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read (for example, may read text accurately but not understand the sequence, relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read. (3) Difficulties with spelling (e.g. adding, deleting or substituting vowels or consonants) (4) Difficulties with written expression (e.g. making many grammatical errors and grammatical errors within sentences, unorganized uses in paragraphs, Lacks the clear written expression of ideas) (5) Difficulties in mastering the concept of numbers, the foundations of numbers, or performing arithmetic operations (for example, he has a weakness in understanding numbers, their value, and the relationships between them, uses his hands to count when adding single-digit numbers instead of Recalling arithmetic operations as his peers do. He gets lost in the arithmetic operations and may change procedures. (6) Difficulties with mathematical reasoning (e.g. , has severe difficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or procedures to solve quantitative problems).
Scientists have identified a number of behavioral and educational characteristics that can distinguish individuals with learning difficulties, which are:
• Problems in the attention process
• Difficulties in reading (eg decoding and comprehension)
• Weakness in motor abilities
• Difficulties with written language (such as spelling and written expression)
• Difficulties in oral language (such as listening, speaking, and understanding)
• Deficiencies in social skills
• Deficiencies in psychological processes
• Quantitative disorders (e.g., arithmetic, problem solving)
• Information processing problems

Basic mathematical concepts include skills such as counting items, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The numeracy skills that these tests measure are essential to functioning well in society, and they prepare students for high-level learning in science and mathematics. The defect in mathematics may not be apparent until higher mathematical operations are required. However, difficulties in mathematics can be discovered when children begin to learn the multiplication tables. These children may learn a multiplication table one day and then forget it the next day. Children in the early years may find it particularly difficult to learn from the left. They may have trouble with memory, such as memory for colors and shapes, and difficulty with early mathematical concepts, such as clocks and money.

Inferential behavior:
a test Inferential behavior is a measure of O's proficiency in using inductive and deductive reasoning to form concepts and solve problems. In the learning process, students need a solid understanding of basic educational concepts and problem solving. This enables them to learn new ideas, and it also helps in subsequent learning because it gives students the ability to link new ideas to previously learned ideas. This promotes stronger long-term memory of concepts. Heuristics are an essential tool for navigating the world, through which we can predict outcomes (“If I move in front of this bike at this moment, it will probably hit me”). It also enables us to solve technical problems that arise during daily life (packing food properly in a grocery bag, using an umbrella when it rains).

Learning style

Triangular pattern
The dominant pattern among the subject is the third pattern, and this pattern includes four sensory modalities: speech, hearing, vision, and touch. The third type person must use the sense of touch in order to feel satisfied. You must feel his fingers and body through touch to build mental images. People of the third type are more socially aggressive than people of the second type. Type 3 people also touch others on their shoulder, back, arm, or hand.
During learning situations, a Type 3 person likes to be active, tapping their fingers or feet on the floor or using a pencil like playing the drums. Part of the body should be in rhythmic movement to enhance information processing. Type 3 people cannot be alone, as they may reach out to strangers for conversation and closeness if friends are not available. They have no concept of boundaries or privacy, and they label Type 1 people as "arrogant" when they ignore them or refuse their touch.
